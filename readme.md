NJIT Schedule Parser
============

Built in 2013, I'm attempting to facilitate a way to pull in NJIT's schedule and query it for 
your own recreational use. Some things that you *could* do with it:

- Query it
- Find courses that fit YOUR NEEDS
- Find courses that are OPEN (haha, loljk they're all going to be closed)
- DO STUFF
